[WikiPrompt](https://qsebring3930.github.io/csci340lab2/) is a starter website I built for class when I took [CSCI 340](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci340/index.html). I utilized languages such as JavaScript and CSS to build a website that utilizes the [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page), in order to help writers past their writer's block. The website generates a random Wikipedia image and a random excerpt from a Wikipedia page.
