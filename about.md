Hello I'm Thomas (They/Them), and I'm a computer science major at [Hendrix college](https://www.hendrix.edu). I'm 23, I enjoy playing video games, expanding my mind through psychedelics, and lounging with my two cats Slim Jim and Cheese. Currently I'm focused on expanding my music taste if you'd like to check out my Spotify, it's linked at the bottom of the page. ![cars](/assets/images/Cars.jpg)
