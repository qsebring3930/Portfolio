[Heart of the Forest](https://twistedsquiddy.itch.io/heart-of-the-forest) was my first game jam attempt shortly after graduation. I was eager to put my skills to use and enjoy all the free time I found myself with so I decided to join the Bullet Hell Jam 2025. I built the entirety of the codebase in Lua on the Love2D framework, with help from my teammate Tommy for all of the sound effects and music for the game.
