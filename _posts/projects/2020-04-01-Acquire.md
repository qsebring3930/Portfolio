[Acquire](https://twistedsquiddy.itch.io/acquire) was my first ever solo game that I built entirely in Java as a final project for [CSCI 151](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci151/). I utilized Java libraries such as Javafx and SceneBuilder to adapt my grandfather's favorite board game into a computer game.

You can view the repository for this project [here](https://github.com/qsebring3930/Acquire).
