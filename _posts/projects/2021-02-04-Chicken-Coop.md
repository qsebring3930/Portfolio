[Chicken Coop](https://qsebring3930.itch.io/chicken-coop) was my first ever game that I built with the Unity engine as a project for [CSCI 370](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/csci370/). I utilized C# and basic collision detection scripts to create a game about catching falling eggs into a basket while avoiding catching bombs.

You can view the repository for this project [here](https://github.com/qsebring3930/ChickenCoop).
