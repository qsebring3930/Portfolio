[CS2Mulch](https://mgoadric.github.io/cs2mulch/) is a website I heavily collaborated with my advisor Dr. Goadrich on during my time at Hendrix. I've poured hundreds of hours into customizing the website layout, creating lesson plans, recording videos, creating interactive exercises, and discussing new ways to utilize the CS2Mulch deck of cards to teach new concepts.

This project is one im most proud of, as its currently being used to teach data structures classes at Hendrix College.
