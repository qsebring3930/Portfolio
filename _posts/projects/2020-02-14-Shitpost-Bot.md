Shitpost Bot was a personal project of mine inspired by the works of [SHITPOSTBOT 5000](https://www.shitpostbot.com). The project was written entirely in Java and was incredibly fun to build, it is also one of few party tricks of mine to show off.

You can view the repository for this project [here](https://github.com/qsebring3930/ShitpostBot).
